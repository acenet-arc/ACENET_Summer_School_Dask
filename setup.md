title: Setup
---

The exercises in this lesson will be carried out on the virtual cluster we have been using the rest of the course, `pcs.ace-net.training.` If you have a Compute Canada account, you should be able to follow along equally well on any of the Compute Canada general-purpose clusters (Béluga, Cedar, Graham).
